## Experience: 

Khoury College | Northeastern University, Boston, MA | Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Program Design and Implementation | September 2025 â€“ present

  * Lead weekly class labs for 40 students, teaching the design process and coding fundamentals
  * Provide detailed feedback on homework assignments, tests, and student questions during office hours.

Aerial-robot Control and Perception Lab | Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA | Student Researcher | July 2025 â€“ present

  * Work with a team attempting to implement control barrier functions into a drone navigation system, which utilizes image inputs from a depth camera that are processed via     an integrated neural network. 
  * Refining neural network through back-propagation while aiming to minimize gradient explosion

Knack Tutor | Northeastern University, Boston, MA	| January 2025 â€“ present
  * Tutor Northeastern undergraduates in Discrete Structures, Introduction to Program Design and Implementation, and Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning 

ARPL Lab | New York University, New York, NY | Intern | May 2024 â€“ July 2024

  * Worked under a postdoctoral mentor in the ARPL lab designing, programming, and wiring parts for drones.
  * Gained experience in C++ in Arduino IDE, Soldering, Wiring, and Fusion 360 CAD design.

Tsinghua University | Shenzhen, China | Student Researcher | June 2023 â€“ July 2023
  * Worked as a research assistant with a 2D materials graduate team to continue my research from my schoolâ€™s ISR program to integrate the novel polymer, 2DPA-1, into construction wood.
  * Edited research paper on Vanadium Single Atoms Embedded in MOS2, later published in National Library of Medicine

## Projects:

Care-Compass â€“ Healthcare Analysis App |  Python | Team Member | May 2025 â€“ June 2025
  * Built a full stack data-driven web application implementing auto-regressive and cosine-similarity models that process World Health Organization (W.H.O) datasets to create healthcare predictions and comparisons for different countries.
  * Utilized scikit-learn for models, Plotly and Matplotlib for visuals, Streamlit for front-end, and Docker for containerization.

ViTal Hackathon Musculoskeletal Disorders Symptom Checker | JavaScript | Team Member | March 2025
  * Developed a diagnostics tool with React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, on a 5-member team to increase awareness in userâ€™s potential risks for skeletal, muscular, and joint disorders
  * Begins with 5 preliminary questions and then introduces further in-depth prompts, resulting in the top 3 conditions that matched the users' responses, along with percent matches, preventative care measures, and links to specific resources about each disease
  * Achieved 1st place and received positive feedback from judges about the knowledge gained from the site

Json Data Reformatter | Java | May 2025
* Created a Java program that reorganizes sample company, role, and reviews data from a given URL.
* Begins with retrieving Json data from the URL using a Postman GET request, converts the data into Java objects and restructures these objects using Java functions. Converts restructured objects back into Json and sends the data back to the original URL with a Postman POST request.
