## Hi there my name is Arthur Huang!

I am a computer science major with an electrical engineering minor at Northeastern University. I am a very adventurous and team oriented individual who is eager to embark on new projects and opportunites regarding software development and artificial intelligence.

## Technologies and Tools:  

Python, Java, Racket, C++, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, streamlit, Plotly, Matplotlib, Docker, Postman

## Experience: 

Khoury College | Northeastern University, Boston, MA | Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Program Design and Implementation | September 2025 â€“ present

  * Lead weekly class labs for 40 students, teaching the design process and coding fundamentals
  * Provide detailed feedback on homework assignments, tests, and student questions during office hours.

Aerial-robot Control and Perception Lab | Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA | Student Researcher | July 2025 â€“ present

  * Work with a team attempting to implement control barrier functions into a drone navigation system, which utilizes image inputs from a depth camera that are processed via     an integrated neural network. 
  * Refining neural network through back-propagation while aiming to minimize gradient explosion

Knack Tutor | Northeastern University, Boston, MA	| January 2025 â€“ present
  * Tutor Northeastern undergraduates in Discrete Structures, Introduction to Program Design and Implementation, and Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning 

ARPL Lab | New York University, New York, NY | Intern | May 2024 â€“ July 2024

  * Worked under a postdoctoral mentor in the ARPL lab designing, programming, and wiring parts for drones.
  * Gained experience in C++ in Arduino IDE, Soldering, Wiring, and Fusion 360 CAD design.

Tsinghua University | Shenzhen, China | Student Researcher | June 2023 â€“ July 2023
  * Worked as a research assistant with a 2D materials graduate team to continue my research from my schoolâ€™s ISR program to integrate the novel polymer, 2DPA-1, into construction wood.
  * Edited research paper on Vanadium Single Atoms Embedded in MOS2, later published in National Library of Medicine

## Projects:

Care-Compass â€“ Healthcare Analysis App |  Python | Team Member | May 2025 â€“ June 2025
  * Built a full stack data-driven web application implementing auto-regressive and cosine-similarity models that process World Health Organization (W.H.O) datasets to create healthcare predictions and comparisons for different countries.
  * Utilized scikit-learn for models, Plotly and Matplotlib for visuals, Streamlit for front-end, and Docker for containerization.

ViTal Hackathon Musculoskeletal Disorders Symptom Checker | JavaScript | Team Member | March 2025
  * Developed a diagnostics tool with React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, on a 5-member team to increase awareness in userâ€™s potential risks for skeletal, muscular, and joint disorders
  * Begins with 5 preliminary questions and then introduces further in-depth prompts, resulting in the top 3 conditions that matched the users' responses, along with percent matches, preventative care measures, and links to specific resources about each disease
  * Achieved 1st place and received positive feedback from judges about the knowledge gained from the site
