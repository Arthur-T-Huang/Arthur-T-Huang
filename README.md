Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Program Design and Implementation 
●	Lead weekly class labs for 40 students, teaching the design process and coding fundamentals
●	Provide detailed feedback on homework assignments, tests, and student questions during office hours.

Aerial-robot Control and Perception Lab - Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA            July 2025 – present
Student Researcher
●	Work with a team attempting to implement control barrier functions into a drone navigation system, which utilizes image inputs from a depth camera that are processed via an integrated neural network. 
●	Refining neural network through back-propagation while aiming to minimize gradient explosion

Knack Tutor - Northeastern University, Boston, MA			              			January 2025 – present
●	Tutor Northeastern undergraduates in Discrete Structures, Introduction to Program Design and Implementation, and Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning 

ARPL Lab - New York University, New York, NY                                                                                 May 2024 – July 2024
Intern
●	Worked under a postdoctoral mentor in the ARPL lab designing, programming, and wiring parts for drones.
●	Gained experience in C++ in Arduino IDE, Soldering, Wiring, and Fusion 360 CAD design.

Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China                                      					  June 2023 – July 2023
Student Researcher
●	Worked as a research assistant with a 2D materials graduate team to continue my research from my school’s ISR program to integrate the novel polymer, 2DPA-1, into construction wood.
Edited research paper on Vanadium Single Atoms Embedded in MOS2, later published in National Library of Medicine

##Projects:
Care-Compass – Healthcare Analysis App; Python; Team Member 				May 2025 – June 2025                                                      
●	Built a full stack data-driven web application implementing auto-regressive and cosine-similarity models that process World Health Organization (W.H.O) datasets to create healthcare predictions and comparisons for different countries.
●	Utilized scikit-learn for models, Plotly and Matplotlib for visuals, Streamlit for front-end, and Docker for containerization.

ViTal Hackathon Musculoskeletal Disorders Symptom Checker; JavaScript; Team Member 		March 2025
•	Developed a diagnostics tool with React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, on a 5-member team to increase awareness in user’s potential risks for skeletal, muscular, and joint disorders
•	Begins with 5 preliminary questions and then introduces further in-depth prompts, resulting in the top 3 conditions that matched the users' responses, along with percent matches, preventative care measures, and links to specific resources about each disease
•	Achieved 1st place and received positive feedback from judges about the knowledge gained from the site
